# plover-game-mode

## A monkeypatch-type plugin for plover that allows use of a steno keyboard (specifically a Univ4) in games such as Epistory and/or Nanotale.

The behaviours of the plugin are to:
- Re-type entire compound words. 
    - In Epistory, backspace will remove an entire word, so compound words will not type correctly from Plover. By backspacing the whole word and re-typing it as part of Plover's output, this allows words of any length to be written in-game.


## Other notes
Epistory can be modded, and you can change both the controls, and the wordlist, see
